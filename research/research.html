        we investigate that FRBs are generated via coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) 
        off low-frequency X-mode electromagnetic waves (fast magnetosonic waves) by bunches 
        at a distance of a few hundred times the magnetar radius.The following findings are revealed:
	(1) Crustal oscillations during a flaring event would excite kHz Alfv\'en waves. 
	Fast magnetosonic waves with essentially the same frequency can be generated directly or 
	be converted from Alfv\'en waves at a large radius, with an amplitude large enough to power FRBs 
	via the ICS process. (2) The cross section increases rapidly with radius and significant 
	ICS can occur at r$r\gtrsim100R_\star$ with emission power much greater than the curvature radiation 
	power but still in the linear scattering regime. (3) The low-frequency fast magnetosonic 
	waves naturally redistribute a fluctuating relativistic plasma in the charge-depleted region 
	to form bunches with the right size to power FRBs. (4) The required bunch net charge density 
	can be sub-Goldreich–Julian, which allows a strong parallel electric field to accelerate the 
	charges, maintain the bunches, and continuously power FRB emission. (5) This model can account 
	for a wide range of observed properties of repeating FRB bursts, including high degrees of linear 
	and circular polarization and narrow spectra as observed in many bursts from repeating FRB sources.

	  In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.2448Q/abstract">
	    Qu & Zhang (2023)</a>, we systematically investigate a variety of polarization mechanisms of FRBs within the magnetar
theoretical framework considering two emission sites inside and outside the magnetosphere. For each site, we discuss both
intrinsic radiation mechanisms and propagation effects. Inside the magnetosphere, we investigate the polarization properties
of both coherent curvature radiation and inverse Compton scattering by charged bunches and conclude that both mechanisms
produce 100 per cent linear polarization at an on-axis geometry but can produce circular polarization if the viewing angle is
off axis. The lack of circular polarization for the majority of bursts requires that the bunches have a large transverse dimension
size. Resonant cyclotron absorption within magnetosphere may produce high circular polarization if electrons and positrons
have an asymmetric Lorentz factor distribution. Outside the magnetosphere, the synchrotron maser emission mechanism in
general produces highly linearly polarized emission. Circular polarization would appear at off-beam angles but the flux is greatly
degraded and such bursts are not detectable at cosmological distances. Synchrotron absorption in a nebula with ordered magnetic
field may reduce the circular polarization degree. Cyclotron absorption in a strongly magnetized medium may generate significant
circular polarization. Faraday conversion in a medium with field reversal can convert one polarization mode to another. The
two absorption processes require stringent physical conditions. Significant Faraday conversion may be realized in a magnetized
dense environment involving binary systems or supernova remnants.

	  In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.2020Q/abstract">
	    Qu, Kumar & Zhang (2022)</a>, we study the large-amplitude-wave effect of FRBs in
	    the presence of a strong magnetic field. We find that FRB radiation travelling through 
	    the open field line region of a magnetar’s magnetosphere does not suffer much loss 
	    due to two previously ignored factors: (1) The plasma is likely to be flowing outwards 
	    at a high Lorentz factor in the outer magnetosphere. (2) The angle between the wave vector 
	    and the magnetic field line in the outer magnetosphere is likely of the order of 0.1 radian 
	    or smaller due in part to the intense FRB pulse that tilts open magnetic field lines so that 
	    they get aligned with the pulse propagation direction. Both these effects reduce the 
	    interaction between the FRB pulse and the plasma substantially.

        We present the numerical results of the scattering optical depth as a function of gamma_p and theta_B. 
	The three black curves are the effective optical depth (tau=1) curves for three multiplicity values 
	xi=1, 10^2 and 10^4, respectively.
	There is a clear edge on the right side of the diagram with a slopt of theta_B~gamma_p^{-1}. This arises from the 𝐵𝑝
fact that the scattering cross section drops rapidly for omega_B'/omega'> a theta_B'.

		 We show that when the angular size of the emission region is larger than the Doppler beaming angle, 
		the observed spectral width Delta{nu}/{nu_0}>0.58 due to the high latitude effects 
		for a source outside the magnetosphere, even when the spectrum in the source's comoving frame is monochromatic. 
		The angular size of the source for magnetospheric models of FRBs can be smaller than the Doppler beaming angle, 
		in which case this geometric effect does not influence the observed bandwidth.
		We discuss various propagation effects to determine if any could transform a broad-spectrum radio pulse 
		into a narrow-spectrum signal at the observer's location. 
		We find that plasma lensing and scintillation can result in a narrow bandwidth in the observed spectrum. 
		However, the likelihood of these phenomena being 
		responsible for the narrow observed spectra with Delta{nu}/{nu_0}<0.58 in the fairly large observed sample 
		of FRBs is exceedingly small.

	  In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511..972Q/abstract">
	    Qu & Zhang (2022)</a>, we study possible neutrino emission from FRB-
	    emitting magnetars by developing a general theoretical framework. We consider 
	    three different sites for proton acceleration and neutrino emission i.e. 
	    within the magnetosphere, in the current sheet region beyond the light cylinder, 
	    and in relativistic shocks far away from the magnetosphere. 
	    The neutrino flux from FRB 200428 and its associated X-ray burst is calculated. 
	    The flux of the most optimistic case invoking magnetospheric proton acceleration is still∼4 orders of
            magnitude below the IceCube sensitivity. We also estimate the diffuse neutrino background from all 
	    FRB-emitting magnetars in the universe. The total neutrino flux of magnetars during their 
	    FRB-emission phases is a negligible fraction of observed diffuse emission even under the 
	    most optimistic magnetospheric scenario for neutrino emission.

      <h3> Long Period Radio Transients </h3>
      <img src="LPRT_cartoon.jpg" align="right" width="500" height="250">
      <p>
	      A growing population of long-period radio transients has been discovered and their physical 
	      origin is still up to debate. Recently, a new such source named ILT J1101 + 5521 was discovered, 
	      which is in a white dwarf (WD) -- red dwarf (RD) binary system, with the observed 125.5 min period 
	      in radio emission being identified as the orbital period and the radio emission occurs 
	      at the inferior conjunction of the WD. 
      </p>

      <p>
	In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240905978Q/abstract">
	  Qu & Zhang (2024)</a>, we suggest that the radio emission properties of the system 
	      can be well explained within the framework of the unipolar inductor magnetic interaction model between 
	      the magnetized WD and the RD with low magnetization, with a relativistic version of electron cyclotron 
	      maser emission being the most likely radiation mechanism. We suggest that this mechanism can interpret 
	      at least some long-period radio transients, especially the ultra-long period sub-population. High-energy 
	      emission in X-rays and r$\gamma$-rays are predicted within this model from different emission regions, 
	      which are observable under favorable geometric configurations.
