      <h3> Fast Radio Bursts </h3>

	<li> Emission Mechanism  </li>

	<p> In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...972..124Q/abstract">
          Qu & Zhang (2024)</a>,
        we propose that FRBs are generated via coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) 
        off low-frequency X-mode electromagnetic waves (fast magnetosonic waves) by bunches 
        at a distance of a few hundred times the magnetar radius.

        crust quakes.

	  In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.2448Q/abstract">
	    Qu & Zhang (2023)</a>, we systematically investigate a variety of polarization mechanisms of FRBs within the magnetar
theoretical framework considering two emission sites inside and outside the magnetosphere. For each site, we discuss both
intrinsic radiation mechanisms and propagation effects.

	<li> Large-amplitude-wave effect </li>
	<img src="./research/large_amplitude_contour.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="212">
	<p>
	  In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.2020Q/abstract">
	    Qu, Kumar & Zhang (2022)</a>, we study the large-amplitude-wave effect of FRBs in
	    the presence of a strong magnetic field. We find that FRB radiation travelling through 
	    the open field line region of a magnetarâ€™s magnetosphere does not suffer much loss 
	    due to two previously ignored factors: (1) The plasma is likely to be flowing outwards 
	    at a high Lorentz factor in the outer magnetosphere. (2) The angle between the wave vector 
	    and the magnetic field line in the outer magnetosphere is likely of the order of 0.1 radian 
	    or smaller due in part to the intense FRB pulse that tilts open magnetic field lines so that 
	    they get aligned with the pulse propagation direction. Both these effects reduce the 
	    interaction between the FRB pulse and the plasma substantially.

      <h3> Long Period Radio Transients </h3>
      <img src="./research/LPRT_cartoon.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="310">
      <p>
	      A growing population of long-period radio transients has been discovered and their physical 
	      origin is still up to debate. Recently, a new such source named ILT J1101 + 5521 was discovered, 
	      which is in a white dwarf (WD) -- red dwarf (RD) binary system, with the observed 125.5 min period 
	      in radio emission being identified as the orbital period and the radio emission occurs 
	      at the inferior conjunction of the WD. 
      </p>

      <p>
	In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240905978Q/abstract">
	  Qu & Zhang (2024)</a>, we suggest that the radio emission properties of the system 
	      can be well explained within the framework of the unipolar inductor magnetic interaction model between 
	      the magnetized WD and the RD with low magnetization, with a relativistic version of electron cyclotron 
	      maser emission being the most likely radiation mechanism. We suggest that this mechanism can interpret 
	      at least some long-period radio transients, especially the ultra-long period sub-population. High-energy 
	      emission in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays are predicted within this model from different emission regions, 
	      which are observable under favorable geometric configurations.
